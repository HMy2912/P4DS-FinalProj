**About the Project**

Inspiring from our teacher sharing in the last day of the lecture Programming for Data Science about how we can try to go through bad times, we decide to look for a topic related to. Moreover, we are expecting to see a positive vibe in tech industry around the world about the mental health problems.

We use the dataset [OSMI Mental Health in Tech Survey 2016](https://www.kaggle.com/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-2016)
